## Research Agenda {-}

  - **Next-Gen AI in Transport (LMMs & Vision)** : Advancing beyond traditional computer vision to deploy Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) for real-time traffic anomaly detection and autonomous logistics. My current roadmap focuses on integrating unstructured data (video/text/sensors) into predictive safety models, utilizing Edge AI for low-latency decision-making in mixed-traffic environments.
  
  - **Urban Climate Resilience & Social Equity** : Assessing the vulnerability of multimodal urban networks to climate stressors, with a specific focus on accessibility for vulnerable populations. My research quantifies how extreme weather impacts the daily commute to essential services (employment, healthcare, leisure) for marginalized communities. By evaluating city-wide intermodality and network redundancy, I aim to design resilient public transport systems that ensure equitable access during environmental disruptions.
  
  - **International Funding Targets** : Preparing collaborative grant proposals to fund the development of "Digital Twins" for highway concessions in developing economies.

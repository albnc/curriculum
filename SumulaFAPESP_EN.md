> *This work significantly contributes to understanding urban road network vulnerability to extreme events such as floods, with potential social impact on risk management and urban resilience. Scientifically, it advances spatial modeling of accessibility under adverse conditions. The proposed methodology has been the basis for ongoing research on emergency mobility, road safety, and adaptive planning, as well as fostering innovation in decision support tools for public policies.*

> *This study, derived from PhD co-supervision at the University of Melbourne, introduces an innovative approach by integrating non-regularized spatial representations into graph neural network models for citywide crash risk prediction. The technological and scientific impact is notable, advancing the state of the art in artificial intelligence applied to road safety. The research strengthens ongoing projects on accident prediction and prevention, with potential application in intelligent transportation systems and safer, more proactive urban mobility policies.*
